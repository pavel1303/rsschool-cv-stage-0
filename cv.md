## About Me
---
Now i donâ€™t have experience in development. I worked in HoReCa a lot of time, and now i feel the need change my profession. Three month ago i start to learn a Frontend-develepment. And now i learn to RS School. I want to finish learn in the RS School and start to work Junior Web-Developer. Achievements in my previous job: I started my career in my previous job as a bartender, but after two months I became a bar manager, and after ten months I became a top manager in a bar. For this I worked a lot, and also improved my knowledge by participating in seminars, reading thematic literature and taking courses.
